# RemoteGPS - Portable GPS logger
RemoteGPS is just another GPS logger that logs GPS location data to a web server, using GPRS module. This data from the server can be retrieved by a mobile app so that the real-time location can be shown on a map. Also, a history of previous locations can be plotted which gives the path travelled by RemoteGPS module.
